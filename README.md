# Vietnam-Currency-Converter Version 1.0
Code for Android App, that converts Vietnamese Dong to Indian Rupee and the US dollar and vice-versa.
Just created this project to use the app for the currency conversion [Typical Indian Behaviour, to satisfy the Indian in me! ðŸ˜Š] for my vacation to Vietnam. Wanted an app, that can be used when offline, as network was not really reliable. 
You can clone the code in Android studio and run them as it is to observe, the different currency conversion.

By default, you'll open the app to the INR to VND or USD conversion.
